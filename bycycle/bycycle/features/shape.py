    """Compute shape features for each cycle.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sig : 1d array
        Time series.
    fs : float
        Sampling rate, in Hz.
    f_range : tuple of (float, float)
        Frequency range for narrowband signal of interest (Hz).
    center_extrema : {'peak', 'trough'}
        The center extrema in the cycle.

        - 'peak' : cycles are defined trough-to-trough
        - 'trough' : cycles are defined peak-to-peak

    find_extrema_kwargs : dict, optional, default: None
        Keyword arguments for function to find peaks and troughs (:func:`~.find_extrema`)
        to change filter parameters or boundary. By default, the filter length is set to three
        cycles of the low cutoff frequency (``f_range[0]``).
    n_cycles : int, optional, default: 3
        Length of filter, in number of cycles, at the lower cutoff frequency.

    Returns
    -------
    df_shape_features : pandas.DataFrame
        Dataframe containing cycle shape features. Each row is one cycle. Columns:

        - ``period`` : period of the cycle
        - ``time_decay`` : time between peak and next trough
        - ``time_rise`` : time between peak and previous trough
        - ``time_peak`` : time between rise and decay zero-crosses
        - ``time_trough`` : duration of previous trough estimated by zero-crossings
        - ``volt_decay`` : voltage change between peak and next trough
        - ``volt_rise`` : voltage change between peak and previous trough
        - ``volt_amp`` : average of rise and decay voltage
        - ``volt_peak`` : voltage at the peak
        - ``volt_trough`` : voltage at the last trough
        - ``time_rdsym`` : fraction of cycle in the rise period
        - ``time_ptsym`` : fraction of cycle in the peak period
        - ``band_amp`` : average analytic amplitude of the oscillation
        - ``sample_peak`` : sample at which the peak occurs
        - ``sample_zerox_decay`` : sample of the decaying zero-crossing
        - ``sample_zerox_rise`` : sample of the rising zero-crossing
        - ``sample_last_trough`` : sample of the last trough
        - ``sample_next_trough`` : sample of the next trough

    Notes
    -----
    Peak vs trough centering:

        - By default, the first extrema analyzed will be a peak, and the final one a trough.
        - In order to switch the preference, the signal is simply inverted and columns are renamed.
        - Columns are slightly different dependent on ``center_extrema`` being 'peak' or 'trough'.
