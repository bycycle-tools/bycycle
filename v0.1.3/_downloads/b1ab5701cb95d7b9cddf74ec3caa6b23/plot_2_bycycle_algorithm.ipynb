        "\n2. Cycle-by-cycle algorithm\n===========================\n\nDemonstration of the cycle-by-cycle approach.\n\nIn the last tutorial notebook, I described the conventional approach for analyzing time-varying\nproperties of neural oscillations, and in this notebook, we will go over our alternative approach.\nThe fundamental goal of this approach is to characterize neural oscillations directly in the time\ndomain. However, this is not straightforward because it attempts to extract the properties of the\noscillatory component, despite the large amount of noise. Specifically, there are two very difficult\nproblems:\n\n1. What are the features of the oscillation? How do they vary over time?\n2. During what times is the oscillation present?\n\nThe cycle-by-cycle approach deploys a few strategies to approach these questions. As its name\nindicates, this algorithm segments the signal into individual cycles and then analyzes their\nfeatures separately from one another. Normally, some preprocessing is recommended to aid in\nlocalizing peaks and troughs (eliminating high frequency power that mostly do not comprise the\noscillator of interest). Additionally, a burst detection approach is applied to define the segments\nof the signal to be analyzed for their oscillatory properties.\n\nDuring this process (as with all data analyses), it is important to be aware if the data is being\nprocessed appropriately. As signal processing is complicated, it is very beneficial to visualize\nthe measured features along with the raw data to assure they make sense.\n"

        "0. Preprocess signal\n--------------------\nA crucial part of the cycle-by-cycle approach is the ability to localize the peaks and troughs of\nthe oscillation. Therefore, some preprocessing of the signal is often useful in order to make\nthese extrema more apparent, i.e. isolate the oscillation component and minimize the\nnonoscillatory components. One effective way of doing this is by applying a lowpass filter. The\nchoice of cutoff frequency is very important. The cutoff frequency should not be low enough in\norder to remove high frequency \"noise\" that interferes with extrema localization but not so low\nthat it deforms the shape of the oscillation of interest. In order to assess this, the user should\nplot the filtered signal in comparison to the original signal.\n\n"

        "4. Determine parts of signal in oscillatory burst\n-------------------------------------------------\nNote above that the signal is segmented into cycles and the dataframe provides properties for each\nsegment of the signal. However, if no oscillation is apparent in the signal at a given time, the\nproperties for these \"cycles\" are meaningless. Therefore, it is useful to have a binary indicator\nfor each cycle that indicates whether the cycle being analyzed is truly part of an oscillatory\nburst or not. Recently, significant interest has emerged in detecting bursts in signals and\nanalyzing their properties (see e.g. Feingold et al., PNAS, 2015). Nearly all efforts toward burst\ndetection relies on amplitude thresholds, but this can be disadvantageous because these algorithms\nwill behave very differently on signals where oscillations are common versus rare.\n\nIn our approach, we employ an alternative technique for burst detection. There are 3 thresholds\nthat need to be met in order for a cycle to be classified as part of an oscillatory burst.\n\n1. amplitude consistency - consecutive rises and decays should be comparable in magnitude.\n\n- The amplitude consistency of a cycle is equal to the maximum relative difference between rises\n  and decay amplitudes across all pairs of adjacent rises and decays that include one of the\n  flanks in the cycle (3 pairs)\n- e.g. if a rise is 10mV and a decay is 7mV, then its amplitude consistency is 0.7.\n\n2. period consistency - consecutive cycles should be comparable in duration\n\n- The period consistency is equal to the maximu relative difference between all pairs of\n  adjacent periods that include the cycle of interest (2 pairs: current + previous cycles and\n  current + next cycles)\n- e.g. if the previous, current, and next cycles have periods 60ms, 100ms, and 120ms,\n  respectively, then the period consistency is min(60/100, 100/120) = 0.6.\n\n3. monotonicity - the rise and decay flanks of the cycle should be mostly monotonic\n\n- The monotonicity is the fraction of samples that the instantaneous derivative (numpy.diff) is\n  consistent with the direction of the flank.\n- e.g. if in the rise, the instantaneous derivative is 90% positive, and in the decay, the\n  instantaneous derivative is 80% negative, then the monotonicity of the cycle would be 0.85\n  ((0.9+0.8)/2)\n\nBelow, we load a simulated signal and then define 3 sets of thresholds ranging from liberal to\nconservative.\n\nLoad a simulated signal and apply a lowpass filter\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n"
